I am Application Developer for the [University of Nevada, Las Vegas](https://www.unlv.edu/), [University Libraries](https://www.library.unlv.edu/) dedicated to the [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.library.unlv.edu/speccol/). Most of my work these days comprises of developing a new digital repository based on [Islandora 8](https://islandora.ca/content/islandora-8-fact-sheet) and supporting [ArchivesSpace](https://archivesspace.org/). 

 Previously, I was the Electronic Records Archivist for the [Duke University Archives](https://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/uarchives) and an Assistant Professor of [Archival Studies at Clayton State University](https://www.clayton.edu/mas/). He has been developing IT solutions for special collections and archives, off and on, since his days as an undergraduate student.

This blog serves as a lab notebook. I intend to use it to document various strategies and bits I learn as I go along; especially bits that aren't posted in a public code repository. Only time will tell if I actually use it! üòÅ
